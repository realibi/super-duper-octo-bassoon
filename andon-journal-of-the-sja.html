        <h1>Andon, Journal of the SJA</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Providing information about the art of Japan was always one of the
          main aims of the Society for Japanese Art. The publication of a
          periodical was, in fact, high on the list of intentions when the
          Society was founded in 1937. The first issue of the Society’s Bulletin
          (in Dutch) appeared in October 1938 and was received with great
          enthusiasm. Over the following years, the Bulletin would carry
          articles, reviews, announcements, and Society news, keeping members
          abreast of developments and events.

        <h3>Shedding light on Japanese art</h3>
        <p>
          During the early years of the Second World War, the board presented an
          attitude of optimism and made it a point never to refer to what was
          euphemistically called “the political situation”. But by 1943 the
          circumstances could no longer be ignored and the Society’s activities,
          including the publication of the Bulletin, came to a standstill. After
          the war, attempts were made to restore lost contacts and revive the
          Society. The Bulletin re-emerged in 1948, but it proved difficult to
          keep the momentum. It appeared at ever greater intervals and was, in
          the early 1960s, gradually replaced by a newsletter. As the number of
          non-Dutch members was steadily increasing, it was decided in 1963 to
          publish the newsletter in both Dutch and English, and to include
          information about publications and events outside the Netherlands.

        <h3>A proper journal</h3>
        <p>
          By the end of the 1970s, however, the need for “a proper journal” was
          keenly felt. So qualms about the costs were set aside and the
          intention to publish an English-language periodical was officially
          announced at the General Members’ Meeting of 1980. Its name would be
          Andon (Japanese for lantern), and its motto and subtitle “shedding
          light on Japanese art.” The name was an idea of Willem R. van Gulik,
          later director of the Leiden Museum of Ethnology, and professor of
          Japanese art and material culture at Leiden University. Andon came
          into the world early in 1981, as a quarterly publication in black and
          white.

          Distribution costs proved an unpleasant surprise. It was again Willem
          van Gulik who came up with a solution: advertisements. This took some
          getting used to, but it turned out to be an excellent idea. Publishing
          Andon as a quarterly in the end turned out to be too ambitious. Quite
          often there was simply not enough copy and the costs of postage were,
          of course, considerable. In 2008 it was decided only to bring out two
          issues per year, but to increase the number of pages and carry more
          articles. Specials issues were published on several occasions: Andon
          87 (december 2009), for instance, was a special about tattoos in
          Japanese prints, to go with the Japan Tattoo exhibition at the Leiden
          Siebold House in 2009-2010; Andon 97 (September 2014) presented the
          papers of the Society's 75th-anniversary conference on Japanese art
          and society from 1904 to 1930, Years of irony & paradox (Leiden,
          January 2013).

        <h3>A new design</h3>
        <p>
          Graphic designer Robert Schaap’s 34-year involvement with Andon began
          in 1982 (issue no. 6), when he took on the layout of the articles. The
          first 20 Andons had carried a front cover design by Alice
          Horodisch-Garman, but in 1986 Schaap gave no. 21 a new full-colour
          cover – all images, however, were still in black and white.
          Full-colour illustrations first appeared in issue no. 63 (1999), when
          Schaap introduced a new cover design, and a larger format. The last
          issue of Andon designed by Schaap was issue 100, which appeared in the
          winter of 2015. Henri Ritzen and Marga Kanters of
          Ritzen-Design-Consult took over as designers in 2016, giving Andon a
          new look and balance. The first issue with the new design was Andon
          101 (April 2016).

          Over the years Andon has developed into a scholarly journal with an
          international reputation. However, its focus has ever been, and still
          is, the art object itself. The articles presented in Andon not only
          come from scholars, but also from collectors and art dealers. In
          addition, Andon is keen to be a platform for young scholars: the
          editorial team has considerable experience with first-time publishers,
          and is curious and open-minded. (For more details on the history of
          the SJA Bulletin and Andon, read Arendie Herwig's article in Andon
          100, December 2015, pp. 76-86.)
